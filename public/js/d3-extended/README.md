# [d3 Extended](http://wbkd.github.io/d3-extended/)

d3 Extended is **compatible with d3 v4**. If you are looking for the v3 compatible module you can find it on the [v3 branch](https://github.com/wbkd/d3-extended/tree/v3).

This module extends [d3-selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection) with helpful functions which are similar to the jQuery API. If you want to get to know more about this project, feel free to read the blog post: [Replacing jQuery with d3](http://blog.webkid.io/replacing-jquery-with-d3).
